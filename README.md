# snowhackpad

I created this Hackpad because I wanted to explore hardware and learn how to use different software.

## What softwared I learned throughout this project
* Fusion360
* Python
* KiCAD
## Challenges
* Firmware. I didnt know about Python much and KMK. I read some docs and looked some example. I wrote my firmware and I hope for the best.
* Fusion360 : It's a really new software for me. I had some problems but in the end, the result looks promising.
